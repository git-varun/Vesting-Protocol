# Vesting Protocol

Welcome to the Vesting Protocol repository. This project implements a vesting protocol using Solidity, a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

Vesting is a process by which an employee or investor gradually gains access to their stock or assets over time. This is often used in situations where an employee earns their equity over the course of their employment, or where an investor's shares are gradually released over the duration of their investment period.

This project provides a decentralized solution for implementing a vesting schedule on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation of a vesting agreement between two parties, the vestor and the vestee, and handles the gradual release of assets according to the agreed-upon schedule.

## Key Components

- **Smart Contracts**: The smart contracts implement the logic of the vesting protocol, such as the rules for how and when vested assets are released.

- **Tests**: The tests verify that the contracts behave as expected and help catch any bugs or security vulnerabilities.

- **Migrations**: The migration scripts are used to deploy the contracts to the Ethereum network, preparing them for use in a live or test environment.

- **Build System and Configuration**: The build system manages dependencies and configures the project for development and deployment.

- **Coverage Reports**: The coverage reports show how much of the contract code is covered by the tests, helping to ensure thorough testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies with `npm install`. You can compile the contracts with `truffle compile`, run the tests with `truffle test`, and deploy the contracts with `truffle migrate`.
